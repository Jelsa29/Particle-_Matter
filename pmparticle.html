            <h2>What is Particle Matter?</h2>
            <p>Pollution occurs when substances or energy are introduced into the environment faster than they can be safely dispersed or stored, leading to long-term harm. It can result from natural events like forest fires and volcanic eruptions, as well as human activities such as transportation. Air pollution, even when invisible, can be particularly damaging to the planet. Given its serious impact, efforts are being made to study particulate matter and its effects on society in order to develop solutions that reduce its negative consequences.</p>

            <h2>Scientific Problem</h2>
            <p>Particulate matter is a mixture of microscopic solids and liquid droplets suspended in the air, composed of various pollutants such as allergens, acids, chemicals, and metals. It can be formed through mechanical or chemical processes, with the latter being more harmful due to emissions from burning fossil fuels. Major air pollutants—sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide—are released by vehicles and industrial activities, contributing to respiratory diseases.</p>
            <p>Smaller particles, like PM 2.5, pose the greatest health risks as they penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream, potentially causing lung cancer, strokes, and heart issues. Exposure to particulate pollution is linked to heart disease, asthma, and premature death. Industrial emissions and fossil fuel combustion are major sources of these pollutants.</p>
            <p>In Puerto Rico, Saharan dust—transported from the Sahara Desert by windstorms—exacerbates air pollution, increasing health risks for residents, particularly those with respiratory conditions. This dust affects air quality worldwide, surpassing safety guidelines set by organizations like the WHO and the EU. Massive Saharan dust storms have led to hazardous air conditions, prompting Puerto Rico to implement an air quality warning system to mitigate health impacts.</p>

        <section id="SImpact">
            <h2>Social Impact</h2>
            <p>The AES coal plant in Guayama, Puerto Rico, is a major environmental concern due to its excessive pollution, particularly from coal ash containing toxic heavy metals. These pollutants have been linked to serious health issues, including cancer, respiratory diseases, and neurological disorders. Despite multiple violations of federal clean air standards, AES-PR has continued to exceed emission limits, harming surrounding communities.</p>
            <p>Coal ash, a byproduct of burning coal for energy, has contaminated air, soil, and groundwater in Guayama and Salinas. Residents have experienced increasing rates of asthma and cancer, which many believe are tied to exposure to toxic ash. The company has attempted to repurpose coal ash as construction material after the Dominican Republic banned its import, leading to over 1.5 million tons being dumped in Puerto Rican municipalities.</p>
            <p>Lower-income communities, often with limited health and economic resources, are disproportionately affected by pollution from the coal plant. In addition to Guayama, other municipalities, such as Caguas, also experience environmental contamination. While the EPA has fined AES-PR for violations, enforcement remains insufficient to fully protect affected residents.</p>

        <section id="Statistics">
            <h2>Statistics</h2>
            <p>Particulate matter (PM) can be measured using air quality graphs and scales, such as PM2.5 levels, which indicate air pollution in micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m³). PM2.5 particles are extremely small—about 30 times smaller than a human hair—making them a significant yet often unnoticed threat. Air quality fluctuates due to factors like traffic, fossil fuel power generation, and natural sources such as Sahara Desert dust.</p>
            <p>Data from Caguas between November 13 and December 11, 2024, shows mostly fair air quality, with a peak pollution level of 11μg/m³ on November 23. When compared to San Juan, the air quality was slightly better, with San Juan reaching 12μg/m³ at its highest point. Although levels below 12μg/m³ are considered safe, higher pollution concentrations can impact vulnerable groups like children, the elderly, and individuals with respiratory conditions.</p>
            <p>In Puerto Rico, air pollution poses significant health risks, with 25% of citizens being highly vulnerable to lung-related illnesses. The American Lung Association reported in 2024 that over 820,000 people are at elevated health risk due to worsening air quality. In 2021, air pollution contributed to 485 deaths in Puerto Rico, a relatively lower figure compared to Jamaica, where 1,450 deaths were attributed to pollution.</p>
